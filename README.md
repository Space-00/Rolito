This repo collects 100 v2ray configs from a telegram channel every 5 to 20 minutes

ðŸ’™ Just put this subscription link in a v2ray client and enjoy ðŸ’™

***â­•Importantâ­•: The code collects 100 configs but there are a lot of repeated configs so when the code removes the repeated ones you may get, just as an example, even 15 configs or 70 configs or etc..... but the good part is that there are no repeated configs***
